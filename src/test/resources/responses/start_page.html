This is actually not my first website. I had about 10 pages on my Dell, but it was ripped off by this chick who
pretended to be my friend. The webpages that I had on my Dell never made it to the web. Anyway I just got my font
set. It only took me a few hours! Next comes the background color, or image.

This is gunna be on my main page. So it ought to be good. It won’t be. Wanna know why? It’s because my brain is
soooo damaged that I’m not even sure that I am making sense.

<br><br>

Okay so this is my website that I built almost entirely on my own. I had a little help from my genius uncle Frank.
For the most part I did all the HTML in NotePad myself. It has not been easy, & this page was badly screwed up until
I sent it to Frank, and within, I would say 30 to 40 minutes he sent it back with a new name, but everything, I’m
talkin’ EVERYTHING was perfect. That is why this website is dedicated to him.

<br><br>

This is how I set the site up. On this page is where all of the links will be. They should be directly under this.
On each and every page there will be a spinning “home” button located in the top left-hand corner of the browser.
Click it to get back to this page. Each of the text links will contain a little, or a lot about my life. If you read
every link you will have a pretty good understanding of me.<br><br>


There is also a “Cool Links” image on this page. If you click it, it will take you to my links page. It’s just some
choice sites that I frequent.<br><br><br><br>
