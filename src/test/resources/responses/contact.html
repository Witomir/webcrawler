    <center><h2><u>Life in Florida</center>
    </h2></u>
    <p>I was just on <a href=http://www.tbiman.webs.com>My First Website</a> and I clicked on my “Life in Florida” link,
        and got a message that said something like Sorry Webs cannot find this page. I assume that everyone who has ever
        clicked on my “Life in Florida” link has seen this message. This is because I needed to do what I’m doing now.
        Write the page! </p>

    <p>So this link should contain information on my “Life in Florida.” I have not lived in Florida in over a decade. My
        memory is very poor, but I will attempt to type an accurate link. Here I go with “Life in Florida.”</p>

    <P>Okay, Life in Florida was GREAT! I had many friends in Florida. You can read about my three best friends in
        Florida by clicking either <a href=http://www.tbiman.webs.com/friendsinfl.htm>Here</a>, or by clicking on my
        “Friends in Florida” link on <a href=<a href=http://www.tbiman.webs.com>My First Website</a>.</p>
    <p>I had no worries while I lived if Florida as a kid. Then when I got older, and stared dealing drugs my only worry
        was when the pound ran out, and I had to get more. Getting more was not difficult. All took was me paging my
        man, to make sure he had it. He knew about how long it took me to move a pound. So most of the time he had it
        when I paged him. If he did not he paged his man who got at least 20 pounds at a time. He was <u>never</u> out.
    </p>

    <p>I grew up in Florida. It’s where my friends were. So it was a total pisser when I ODed, and was forced to move to
        Maryland a couple of years later at the age of 18.</p>
